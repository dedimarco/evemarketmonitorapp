  <section title="Import Data" next="Final Words" previous="Reprocess Settings" text="The Import Data button can be used to import data from Eve API XML files and old EMMA data files. Simply select the file you wish to import and follow the instructions.&#xD;&#xA;Bear in mind that if you have a lot of data from an older version of EMMA then it can take a long time to import it all (mine took about an hour).&#xD;&#xA;Also, if you used an older version of EMMA to track investments then it's best to import the .CDAT file before the .DAT file."/>
  <section title="Final Words" next="" previous="Import Data" text="Hopefully you now have a rough idea of all the features EMMA has to offer.&#xD;&#xA;If you have any specific questions, bugs or feature requests then you can contact me directly by eveMail (Ambo), eMail (ambo.emma@googlemail.com), the eve forums (best bet is the EMMA thread in Market Discussions) or the in-game EMMA chat channel (EMMA chat) and mailing list (EMMApp). Thanks for giving EMMA a go and I hope it helps you as much as it's helped me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Trade safe,&#xD;&#xA;Ambo."/>
