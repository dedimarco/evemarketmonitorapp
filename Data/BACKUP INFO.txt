The database files in this directory no longer contain active data, they are simply blank databases.
In order to backup your data, make copies of the database files in your application directory instead.

On Windows XP this will be something like: 
C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\EMMA\Data

Vista & Windows 7:
C:\users\<username>\appdata\roaming\EMMA\Data

Note - you can always find this folder easiest by typing '%appdata%' into a windows explorer window.
