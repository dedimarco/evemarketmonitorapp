EVE Market Monitor Application (EMMA) was created for the online game Eve Online. Discussion related to the project can often be found within the Market Discussion forum of the Eve Online official forums. The software provides for offline viewing of transactions, journal entries, market orders and assets. Reporting functionality is available to summarize historical activity as well as various other helpful pieces of functionality. The program updates automatically from the EVE API and can also import prices from Eve Central or Eve Metrics for asset values and reporting where historical data is not available.
